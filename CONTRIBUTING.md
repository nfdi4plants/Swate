## Requirements

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download), >= 8.0.0
  - verify with `dotnet --version`
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download), >=18
  - verify with `node --version`
- npm, >=9
  - likely part of nodejs installation
  - verify with `npm --version`
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), >= 24
  - verify with `docker --version`
  - this is required for database setup
- Any F# IDE, e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Ionide extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp#:~:text=Ionide-VSCode%20is%20a%20VSCode,powers%20language%20features%20is%20FSAutoComplete.), [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

## Setup

This needs to be done once per repository download.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run dotnet tool restore
3. Run npm install

> [!NOTE]
> After starting the database for the first time you will need to setup the db from online ressources. This can be done by Swobup on
> [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs). You can find the credentials in the [docker-compose](.db/docker-compose.yml) file (SWOBUP_USERNAME=swobup, SWOBUP_PASSWORD=test).
>
> Run:
> 1. PUT `api/v2/database/init`
> 2. PUT `api/v2/ontology/build`
>
> You can verify the correct task execution on [redis](http://localhost:1111). It might happen that some ontologies fail to build, in this case you can try to build them again with `POST api/v2/ontology` and the correct link from our [ontology repository](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/nfdi4plants_ontology).

## Start

`./build.cmd run db`, to start up Swate (+ Database network)

**Swate** runs on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000), **Swobup** on [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs), **Database - Neo4j** can be viewed in the browser on [http://localhost:7474/browser/](http://localhost:7474/browser/).

> [!WARNING]
> Should the neo4j database not correctly start up with `./build.cmd run db` delete the container (only container not the volume) and start it again. This can be easily done with the docker ui. Open the `swate_dev` network and click on the thrash bin icon next to the neo4j container.

                                    release branch (nightly if `pre`), this will trigger
