# Test Setup

This folder contains files to ensure correct test setup:

1. `Base.test.ts`, checks if any tests are run correctly
2. `TestEnsureComponent.tsx`, checks if react components are tested (with tailwind support)
3. `POC.fs`, checks if f# transpilation with react components are correctly tested

This folder will not be included in the final build.
